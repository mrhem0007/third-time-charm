## Welcome to the "third-time-charm" repository 🚀

Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I dive headfirst into the world of 3D experiments using React, React Three Fiber, WebGL, and more!

### Repository Description

"Because the world definitely needed another React dev's 3D experiments. Watch as I turn perfectly good WebGL into questionable entertainment. Side effects may include excessive GPU usage and mild confusion. 🎪"

### Topics

🔗 Repository Topics: 3d, 3d-animation, physics, questionable-physics, rapier-physics, react, react-three-fiber, tailwindcss, threejs, vite, webgl
